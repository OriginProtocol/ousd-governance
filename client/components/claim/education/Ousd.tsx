        OUSD is a yield-bearing stablecoin that grows in your wallet. It offers
        the simplest and safest way to earn passively from DeFi. Every unit of
        OUSD is backed 1:1 by the most trusted collateral in crypto, which means
        that it can be redeemed anytime. There&apos;s no complicated staking
        required and you don&apos;t have to trust the Origin team to manage your
        money. An open-source, fully-audited set of smart contracts governs the
        deployment of funds across conservative yield farming strategies using
        Aave, Compound, and Curve/Convex.

        Today, OUSD is an upgrade over ordinary stablecoins. Tomorrow, it&apos;s
        intended to be the default payment method for Web3. When you pay with
        OUSD or send it to a friend, the balance continues to grow when itâ€™s
        received. Stablecoins are crucial to blockchain commerce, and OUSD is
        the innovation that will bring DeFi to the global economy.
