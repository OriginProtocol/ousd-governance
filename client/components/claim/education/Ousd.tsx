            OUSD is a yield-bearing stablecoin that grows in your wallet. It
            offers the simplest and safest way to earn passively from DeFi.
            Every unit of OUSD is backed 1:1 by the most trusted collateral in
            crypto, which means that it can be redeemed anytime. There&apos;s no
            complicated staking required and you don&apos;t have to trust the
            Origin team to manage your money. An open-source, fully-audited set
            of smart contracts governs the deployment of funds across
            conservative yield farming strategies using Aave, Compound, and
            Curve/Convex.

            Today, OUSD is an upgrade over ordinary stablecoins. Tomorrow,
            it&apos;s intended to be the default payment method for Web3. When
            you pay with OUSD or send it to a friend, the balance continues to
            grow when itâ€™s received. Stablecoins are crucial to blockchain
            commerce, and OUSD is the innovation that will bring DeFi to the
            global economy.
