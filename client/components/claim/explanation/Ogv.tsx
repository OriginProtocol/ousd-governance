        OUSD is not controlled by a corporate entity or a central bank.
        It&apos;s governed by a community of token holders who share the
        long-term vision for creating a superior stablecoin. OGV serves as the
        governance and value accrual token for OUSD and it&apos;s being widely
        distributed to members of the Origin community.
      </p>
      <p>
        With OGV comes the power to shape OUSD and benefit from its growth.
        Holders of OGV are able to lock their tokens for up to four years to
        gain voting rights and earn fees. When OGV is locked, it&apos;s
        converted into veOGV (vote-escrowed OGV) and it becomes
        non-transferable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every aspect of OUSD is controlled by decentralized governance.
        Supporting new collateral types, allocating funds across different
        strategies, and adjusting staking rewards are all examples of decisions
        that are made by veOGV holders. On day one, veOGV holders are able to
        claim 10% of the yield that is generated by the protocol. As OUSD
        adoption accelerates, the benefits accrue to the holders of veOGV.
